It has been a **LONG** time (we don't need to get into quite *how* long ;)) since I was new to contributing to open source, but I was asked for some advice on how to get started. Here's what I came up with, but I'd **love** to hear what others have to say, as well!

# Start with your interests

While open source is amazing, and you can learn SO much and meet SO many wonderful people... let's face it, it can *also* be a bit frustrating/discouraging at times, so it can be greatly beneficial to have a solid personal reason to tough it out. ;)

Here are some questions to help guide you towards a first project:

* What are open source projects you *already* use?
    
* What programming languages are you strongest in, or want to learn?
    
* What problem space / use cases do you find fascinating and want to dig in more?
    

In this particular person's case, they are interested in learning more about AL/ML, and are strongest in Python, and are familiar with [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/), so that is a great combination right there. For me, I was into making websites, and I knew PHP really well, so [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) made a lot of sense.

# Find a welcoming project

Sometimes, the [vibe](https://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/2401.3/04208.html) of a given open source project precedes it, and you have a pretty good idea what you're about to be walking into. But not always. Here are some things you can look for to try and suss out whether a project is likely to welcome new contributors:

* **Do they have a** [**Code of Conduct**](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/)**?** This is normally referenced in their README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md file. A Code of Conduct is generally an indicator of a project striving to be inclusive and welcoming.
    
* **Does their issue tracker have tags such as \[**[**help wanted**](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Ahelp-wanted&type=issues)**\], \[**[**good first issue**](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Agood-first-issue&type=issues)**\], \[**[**first-timers-only**](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Afirst-timers-only&state=open&type=Issues)**\]?** This is indicative of a community doing some form of "triage" to help make their project more accessible to newcomers.
    
* **Do they participate in programs geared toward newer contributors**, such as [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/), or [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)? This can indicate a higher tolerance for new folks and getting started questions.
    
* **Do they highlight ways to contribute *beyond* just code?** For example, documentation, issue triage, user support? This can indicate a project that takes a more holistic view toward what contribution entails.
    

# Community, *before* code

It can be tempting to get super excited, immediately roll up your sleeves, look at a list of [good first issues](https://goodfirstissue.dev/), filter by your language of choice, and go to town.

Instead, look around for a place where they talk about their "Community." This could be mailing lists, Slack/Discord servers, Reddit/StackOverflow communities, Meetups, Forums, and more. Whatever it is, join up and spend a bit of time lurking. You can pretty quickly get a sense of how they prefer to work, who the major decision-makers are, how receptive they are to newcomers, etc. so you don't end up wasting time in both directions.

In the case of Pandas, for example, they hold a [New Contributor Meeting](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/community.html#new-contributor-meeting) on the 3rd Wednesday of the month, specifically to answer newcomer questions. Drupal has a [First Time Contributor Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K0uIgKaVNQ). Both projects have online Slack communities you can join to meet the people behind the projects.

# Start with the Docs

You might not know it yet, but as a newcomer to an open source project, you have this AMAZING superpower: you are often-times the *only* one in that **whole** project capable of reading the documentation through *new* eyes. Because I can *guarantee*, the people who *wrote* that documentation are **not** new. :-)

So take time to read the docs and file issues (or better yet, pull requests) for anything that was unclear. This lets you get a "feel" for contributing in a project/community without needing to go **way** down the deep end of learning coding standards and unit tests and commit signing and whatever other bananas things they're about to make you do. :) Also, people are more likely to take time to help *you*, if you've helped *them* first!

# What are *your* tips/advice?

I'm curious what others would recommend to a new prospective contributor trying to get started on their open source journey? Spout off in the comments! :D
