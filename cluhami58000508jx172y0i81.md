["Friction logging"](https://dev.to/stripe/how-we-use-friction-logs-to-improve-products-at-stripe-i6p) is a form of user experience testing, where you step through a given process and provide insight into your thinking and feelings at various points throughout. The goal is to identify things people with less familiarity with your product / feature might trip on, so you can smooth out your overall experience.

The Founder of a product called [Val Town](https://www.val.town/) put a call out for this kind of feedback:

%[https://twitter.com/stevekrouse/status/1774821785638203561] 

[Simon Willison pointed out](https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1774830087910904191) that this was a pretty cool thing for a Founder to do, and I agree, and moreover I also had very important financial paperwork to procrastinate on ü§£, so I decided to dive in and write up my findings.

*(Folks familiar with my time as a maintainer of the*[*Drupal project*](https://www.drupal.org/)*will remember WebChickTestCase alongside every UI change, this is more or less that. I****deeply****apologize to Steve in advance. üòÖ This all comes firmly from a place of love. üíñ)*

# TL;DR:

* I am a web developer with 20+ years of experience, but limited knowledge of server-side functions / JS.
    
* I purposely did *zero* reading on any of this in advance, in order to test the onboarding flow ‚Äúuninfected‚Äù by prior background knowledge.
    
* In the end, despite several attempts, **I was unable to get one of your simple examples going**, due a combination of outdated docs and PEBCAK (probably).
    
* I was also missing the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of your product‚Äîwhat use cases it solves, in what situations I should use it, etc.
    
* Time spent: about 2 hours
    

# Feedback Key

‚úÖ Like this! This step was quick and easy, or it was particularly nicely done.

ü§î Things that make you go ‚Äúhmmm‚Äù / things that were a bit confusing

üò° Things that were a significant barrier and/or make you want to throw a table ;)

üó≥Ô∏è A concrete suggestion on improving something

# Home Page

[https://www.val.town/](https://www.val.town/)

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/FrKZupIgKMW46YYpDwJ4RtycQK0e0d1Q3hocoefHPhuzb_sXLUWKNEUT_v1Xrr8wISQHWVGiiM9j16poGXmHCYH6uTlbsEE-NykQhAUnzFQYAqd6-qozAX06HAidlzw7ziW6IpQ-DK9BnlYvqR78Vk8 align="left")

ü§î At first glance, I am intrigued, though by the end of this section it looks like a bit of word salad, because I can‚Äôt possibly understand how all of these words go together into one concept. ü§£ I imagine this will change through the course of this exercise.

‚úÖ I like that the intro is short, and ‚ÄúGet started‚Äù is right at the top. I proceed to completely ignore the rest of the page. ;) **CLICK!**

# Sign Up Page

[https://www.val.town/auth/signup](https://www.val.town/auth/signup)

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/K6ekPZTJrzkxcUXF0izDUMciy_Veb-QrNJDf-VeAqqgUlVj_Skglc6pPrAaA3UCQ5CUMvOrCjevDyIACASkUyrX5j6RV5UZrHmlOo402H2Xvqf2CRmIgx2KahHzjUGEug-zkF7VCWwAJNopkIwKxwlU align="left")

ü§î You jump straight to asking me for credentials, how about **giving me a bit of context here** as to what I get out of filling out this form?

(I realize this info was probably all back on the home page, which I unceremoniously skipped, but presumably you‚Äôre going to drive traffic to this page from various content/emails/etc, so the point still stands.)

üó≥Ô∏è **Suggestion:** The page would benefit from an abbreviated ‚Äúwhy‚Äù at the top, like:

‚ÄúVal.town smooshes your smeeshes with great features like:

* Boos your bars
    
* Foos your bazzes
    
* Waddles the very highest of woodles
    

Find our more in our \[LINK\]about the product page\[/LINK\].‚Äù

ü§î I don‚Äôt know you well enough yet to trust you with tying your service to my GitHub account, so I‚Äôm going to go the email route. If you want me to make a different choice here, maybe disclose upfront what permissions you want out of that relationship.

‚úÖ I like that the form is short, and you‚Äôre asking for very little info up front.

# Onboarding

## Handle/Newsletter

[https://www.val.town/onboarding/handle](https://www.val.town/onboarding/handle)

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/yolgyQ6Bk_dhfie2aO7RU6t4nnFw3W8Srnu7MEshlLCCf_ij6qZ_4ZK9bajSYqon5WgSWuB9ayj0Zv_3i7qN4iqWsq_7uVCesV3ZqAY5oQ1H7JtAxka_MZH869-IOicWAhZEN5rVA-qaM5O0loozgLo align="left")

ü§î No email verification? Interesting.

‚úÖ I *really* like the ability to read the newsletter first before deciding to subscribe!

‚úÖ Also like that it opens this in a new tab so that I don‚Äôt lose my place.

üó≥Ô∏è (nit) Put a space between ‚Äúmonth.‚Äù and ‚ÄúRead‚Äù ;)

üó≥Ô∏è The link goes to ALL blog posts, vs. just the newsletter ones; it might be nice to filter by tag there, but it might also be that this is ‚Äúby design‚Äù so I see a fuller picture of the stuff you‚Äôre talking about.

## (Detour) Newsletter Sample

[https://blog.val.town/blog/val-town-newsletter-15/](https://blog.val.town/blog/val-town-newsletter-15/)

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/eiC9nTF3Ytqx9u-9K_ExzfOyshu9vaPDsww2n39jEzuxtHnm1dJOg6DqJaREiDNwZODqrGS8HUgYBhOg6mKoV-DBh4Q_7aPu02_v0RIcS-Tj5WrncisuqrNJTXRsJmXRMMFYJsZvr12iI92WQz60SDs align="left")

‚úÖ Like how visual this is, and also how skimmable it is. Scannable emojis are great.

‚úÖ Like the casual humour (‚Äúfoot gun‚Äù), diagrams to help explain complex concepts.

‚úÖ This random screenshot also showcases that you invite user feedback on your product, nice! :D

## How did you hear?

[https://www.val.town/onboarding/referral](https://www.val.town/onboarding/referral)

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/AThnDYe3TRC5NJQtstCKo9z8Pop1FSUxjxygSOXp9m8PQbyTEuIfvG3WI0_z1BsU36Ej1Wv_oDGQSAGh7XuwQrnEryD7auvgDl_jT7GuAGPXfev2LymEYnNbibkCMchqr0mXbz8DBfGZUv1uD_XY6d4 align="left")

‚úÖ Good idea to ask this question.

‚úÖ Also like that it is skippable in case I‚Äôm not feeling it.

## Sample code

[https://www.val.town/onboarding/val](https://www.val.town/onboarding/val)

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/at-fk6s1rUMGuM6Ftu-IEvy5SLM1JUEMm2TguWWLQ2LeyKIjPcdadqhgGwfBbIDpG4tLW9CvegIqfjfR1THcYiQEA02-j4GTQkHJ8T61fUdsVyjplf_HK2IXHRIDVb90uHf2d6uVVNLEIGsyGY8rY0s align="left")

‚úÖ Neat that there‚Äôs a sample preview of some stuff ready-to-go.

ü§î Why am I ‚ÄúindigoGecko‚Äù and not ‚Äúwebchick‚Äù when I already gave you my username?

üó≥Ô∏è Ah, I figured out later that this is the name of the code. Maybe default it to something less silly then like **HTTPResponseReact1** or something.

ü§î I'm very sorry, but I still have **absolutely no idea what this is for, why I would use it, and how I would use it.**

ü§î There is a "Want details on what each line of this code is doing?" link, which is nice, but that is a bit too granular for my current phase of understanding. The code is not particularly un-easy to read, **I‚Äôm still missing the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat do I DO with this nice chunk of code now?‚Äù**

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/URIFj0lZD3lCFFUvIL2vnHFBqL8z1AXh2OrEeQYMj8Scl4o1Dhu4640QMGF37W9M3-Dddf4OoSmNyPbSiGDDfTyTePNYYR8GaI9eAy-CuhsGSfo7KXYdKhmSf9nl_S_gZtO75uyxxEQyTbC__g5KtK4 align="left")

‚úÖ However, I now know there‚Äôs a Discord I can go to to get extra support if I need it.

üó≥Ô∏è Maybe consider making the Discord community's existence more prominent?

üó≥Ô∏è I notice when I edit text above, I still need to manually click ‚ÄúPreview‚Äù to show below, and there‚Äôs a small pause while I wait for things to reload. **Would be neat if this happened ‚Äúlive‚Äù instead.** (I also would like a rainbow-farting unicorn, please ;))

ü§î Not sure what the point is of the ¬† ¬† { headers: { "Content-Type": "text/html" } }, line, because **when I changed that to "text/json", nothing happened.**

Anyway, ok. Clicking **DONE!**

# Main Interface

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/mxKMzOX6LcGARFUB556ErHlO2Rc3xXDshW9j3Vv5mbRp5EbE8wXnjlSntXGXhwh9hzpBXH2mkU55hAZt4D9jeEq-bA41irg3ePhyRQ0XG8cCrFQ-iDopIDTsncp2q6XQMoeTYHeArWFMio7Y6xOJZ-I align="left")

ü§î Ok, looks like I can create different kinds of ‚Äúvals‚Äù here, and organize them into folders. **What are ‚Äúvals‚Äù and what are they for?**

ü§î Ah, looks like **if I scroll all the way to the bottom** I get some of this info:

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/kJeQNPGSUKkPRKuEba08OQEjaoU4jF2UzFbndqYJLR2M-QjHhK_KoR8cJX0r2NcpMl4PDMu9XStQR17MyizxID7XB1VCw7E_0Rl-SS9WN_wXnh2_03blhG5REhgjVM822CP_jmFijxR5PclHHhjOA5o align="left")

**Suggestion:** move this to the top, maybe in a collapsible section so people who already know their way around can get the compact interface.

‚úÖ ‚ÄúTemplates‚Äù is nice. I like all the copy/pasta examples so I could find something close to what I want and modify it.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/7oimoy7O82SFN5GZSn40RJFFyd0fbv2pFQYOer60OMKmLtV2NmD_Hp0XFFekqtd2hlfy8W1mJdhlNQ3tbRsHAg05H3J-pqftDxVNFAKVcO6zI8-Uya1lOUQoSKUYJOkCQyo05CMVg3va7EgsPsVUO00 align="left")

ü§î Is there a way for the community to contribute to these as well?

ü§î Ok, that said, **my prevailing emotion right now is ‚Äúfeeling lost on what to do next,‚Äù** so I‚Äôm going off to **Docs** in order to see if I can find some kind of ‚ÄúQuickstart‚Äù example that takes me through ‚Äúsoup-to-nuts.‚Äù

# Docs

[https://docs.val.town/](https://docs.val.town/)

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/je1VKqtq7TDRJYz-demXEXxnl7vKC6fh1ExfwxVnjavasjQgV0SBKxa65ZDwg0A5k6TqlUa1EJf1sbOOzk5kUHiYkzrZugcHu4GLkvDAn7MHg8CfwUt1ueaPWIMMZTL4-NDrglMq7rDhts0F4vFBlJc align="left")

ü§î Skimming the home page and the left sidebar, not really finding what I‚Äôm after. Let‚Äôs try **‚ÄúGuides.‚Äù**

üó≥Ô∏è Guides is WAY far down the list; maybe think about moving it up.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/IFr2hpOTKNY27Er451c20OOY98NhM4TrKvJbuIcYM2xvaHSRjY7yBmBdhaOUlbAbzLpUVOT0oRzROSToa23G0y_7HsSXLTuaVo9a6RFicFHNkH4gfpo67qUXxBdbsm2zlKPq0ULwrNRP-86Vj-liFk8 align="left")

ü§î Hmmm. Not sure, this all seems pretty low-level and seems to assume I know more than I do.

Ok, well. One very basic web thing that all web developers need to do is **save HTML form data**, so let‚Äôs try that.

# Save HTML Form Data Guide

[https://docs.val.town/guides/save-html-form-data/](https://docs.val.town/guides/save-html-form-data/)

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/0XAdKmwlFgbPttQIFv22fnrJ2eCAVPSZSmwutb18iBJLL-bz3wkpVMheoxUeeQypQIH33RWjVTED4FKzL6WNZ_rjj0sP_fi_67mB0PXZW_hwFnN2y88xyi4nkFN28a94nQNOi29-GAjL7dc7Rzm8UuM align="left")

‚úÖ Nice! This looks more like it.

‚úÖ Like that both video and written content is provided.

ü§î They are not, however, equivalent. (Maybe that‚Äôs ‚Äúby design‚Äù as well.) ‚Äî the video does more of an overview and the text is more pragmatic, copy/paste.

üó≥Ô∏è **This very video or something similar to it, ought to be on at least the docs home page, if not in the product itself.** In about 30 seconds of hearing you talk, I ‚Äúgot‚Äù it; it being **‚ÄúAdding dynamic stuff to static websites‚Äù is at least *one* use case of your thing. üôÇ** (I would greatly welcome insight on others!)

ü§î Interestingly, when I try to do exactly what‚Äôs outlined in the video, it looks like I can no longer submit feedback on the docs, there is instead an ‚ÄúEdit this page‚Äù and it takes me to GitHub where it prompts me to fork the repo to suggest changes.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/cccKswstbG96XCIJ-AEDdIp88zdlQXda9GYvFUC59JaaODzswpO9HuqV1pa-iou4ON4lZ1eOUlRAtYvlesJe4jUL5otg2jHfmR9BAvoaSFeVXCcCqR3Pgkj5SUgdlJ0tFhPY4Fqcva6GBaokZoX72O0 align="left")

I can understand this being more useful to you as a maintainer, because it encourages people to solve their own problems, but just pointing out that at this point in the journey **I would just bail here without giving you any feedback** because that just seems like *way* too much work for as a drive-by docs bug spotter. ;)

Anyway, let‚Äôs continue down the tutorial.

## (Attempting to) Add an HTTP val

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/4KFSyzYrN8JrUcjTupz5stR36s79FpW0v7L-td6wD1TkcagNHNPwSE_6bdnuUXo9-NGoCBYU9W0FrRjjeFx0Xj3Ah5MKq0wu3gcHWWPzFHmA0Zbcv5JkQ33adtMZPdHb67zWL8p-pmECBpyW8vjippI align="left")

‚úÖ I like that I can just copy/paste this with a handy button.

ü§î It also says I can ‚Äúfork the one below‚Äù but I don‚Äôt see how I to do that. Maybe this is only an option I get if I auth with GitHub, but then it would be nice if either this text didn‚Äôt show up at all, or it mentioned that was a requirement.

ü§î Now that I‚Äôve copied it, to whence do I paste it? I‚Äôm guessing this is back on the other ‚Äúmain‚Äù page where I got confused and went to docs. It would be nice if something here said that. (But maybe this is just knowledge other people innately have and unnecessary.)

Anyway, I go back there:

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/TJ6RWovr0QKHlENLqaN7_aYl_ZWvdZLgw772-ykxmha0xc4qM1miiw6Xra9cNg9f833epB-1_owV84KvtcigBDT2cCWmhAStIoc186Xpn8N4BRWu5ljYVNvhmJJwCe8oS7oIC1ihl5vPNIqB34kUzuc align="left")

ü§î Here‚Äôs an interesting thing. **You told me in the docs that I needed an HTTP val, but HTTP val is not one of the options in this list.** (Maybe you mean HTTP handler?) Nothing under ‚ÄúTemplates‚Äù says ‚ÄúHTTP val‚Äù either.

Ok, so since nothing matches, let‚Äôs try **‚ÄúNew val‚Äù**

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ryGI4biwqr2-NugZAdbSu0sb_KD7RSm9yDuUboDnF5tDQLLRJxmlHvPMFrZcgKcSCmaM0f53k3W7csc0-UPbSo6iGIKvxakV21uU0VKK1UWzOXXyQ1OKngZNXNBayTclthkac7748dsD6WonwkNt9H8 align="left")

ü§î Hmmm. **Ok this is a TOTAL blank slate.**

üó≥Ô∏è It‚Äôd be nice if there was some skeleton code or even some commented out stuff that‚Äôs like ‚ÄúYou need at least a Request and Response object here‚Äù or‚Ä¶ anything.

Anyway, let‚Äôs paste in the code from before and click ‚ÄúRun‚Äù and see what happens.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ytt99pZPexeKmBOSdLHjA0_kUhGwehkCE2eXAECw2Ao4wDqdhJZWGkOdrtcha3qVMFemhY1j1ebUo9PdVwG7ULkgvmGs-XPy76lmHi0CYq5_X2msQhu7P0uw-YtGf8rIG__9wKVHYOueFsSGgWdtJnU align="left")

ü§î Hm. **On the surface, *nothing* at all happened.** Down below, there‚Äôs no ‚ÄúAwaiting connection‚Ä¶‚Äù message or ‚ÄúError: You done screwed up, son‚Äù or *any* output whatsoever, beyond a counter that keeps counting up and a green light. Assuming this is a good thing and expected?

## (Attempting to) Create an HTML form and link it back

Back to the tutorial, copy/pasting the form to just a local form.html file:

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/zwsHdmVy7CIpnEgQd6RQEqgHF1IfYpC82tUlWxQKg57OCWAgkIvDelHS2KGoCLePZtNX5u408vmMLIvu__WvfVnQqZA2E9nzoolnJO5yulP_an2ZYx6kAdAaXvHby0oFkidm7l0cahCrqe7tzdXrxoU align="left")

‚úÖ The video made a big deal about the importance of the form action attribute. I see that you call it out here as well, both in the text above and in a comment above the code.

üò° However, **the instructions here don‚Äôt seem to work.** There is no menu called ‚ÄúEndpoints,‚Äù there *is* a Copy under the ‚Äúthree dots‚Äù menu, but ‚Äúweb endpoint‚Äù is not one of the things I can copy.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/XhBrt-XY2jYMMtjnyi9RoFsWwKUBGjp5aL6QxyC5fIJ9g5u83Fl3YnNp8D6h8VgTByq20UO3LfmkLzaYTfQWzJL9OQd29slYT5oJe8soVSsxIBYGy7Wwv8vkd1xy_2VHfkE4I5qS1Jw7PcYAA0esYgE align="left")

‚úÖ That said, I like the preview of each copy option here, because that at least narrows it down that I probably don‚Äôt want ‚ÄúVal ID‚Äù but rather one of the link/URL ones.

üò° Now to iterate through to find the value that‚Äôs closest to the ‚Äú[https://user-saveFormData.web.val.run](https://user-saveformdata.web.val.run)‚Äù in the sample code:

* Link: [https://www.val.town/v/webchick/tomatoPossum](https://www.val.town/v/webchick/tomatoPossum)
    
* Module URL: [https://esm.town/v/webchick/tomatoPossum](https://esm.town/v/webchick/tomatoPossum)
    
* Embed URL: [https://www.val.town/embed/webchick/tomatoPossum](https://www.val.town/embed/webchick/tomatoPossum)
    

üò° Well, \*&^@#. ;) **NONE of those are anything like the one in the example.** I‚Äôll just go with ‚ÄúLink‚Äù then since it looks similar to what I usually put in form action attributes.

Let‚Äôs try it and see if it works (I don‚Äôt think it will, as there‚Äôs a third section of the docs that I haven‚Äôt looked at yet). Here‚Äôs a checkpoint:

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/RMU8nWTxhil1jyORfe_oyNzg2SBmuNAr6TJ7aJwvzX83JXMT8lC_vZLyzPr_LrMt2cgiPjN317rgXEwGH1lcHKao9PONqRPoVDWSRX5XsWsNOpNBilzw8ib2tDFuDJVqV98qSG5EH2lXFKqSyTnS9mM align="left")

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/quroiB-USV5GzOmRaLTwxldxU9yJ1rlOL0Lp1RVkViKy62ksVPXG62owY28-jT_704lF3z1CdBJ-Sq_N0QXt2JnH_oszQ-3B4hpcGzDnZR6EecnLC0VYupSRoQq_WQwMDapbo6tO20K-m-dx6yjVoxw align="left")

üò° There was a ‚ÄúNot found‚Äù error upon submission, but it disappeared so fast I couldn‚Äôt read it, nor screenshot it. It just took me back to the main page with no message explaining what just happened.

## (Attempting to) Tie everything together

All right, let‚Äôs see if that last bit of the tutorial ties this up for us.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/AIvsibrpfxAOySYrcR9JjljbiXd1lPrQ72gQzqU144mhDBRvb9noKclF00gDnQq9UGaygrUs9nwhuio6SHkBYwgGQx034uRwJg7w0881bs1uc1z22tOtEsglDMy_v-GcPJj1g4OhLvWRvSMhYCnZogc align="left")

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/CSrIR4YSfsp-ONsZADUat1oZ3DQyUo6ixAlv8jyetzMS9B0YY4Ddy1pJnkpBebRr2ZaNYXeOYVLs4FtnoTBphxZjLB64-pOqKvkNad91P2pozO_s5x5lOk0beINH0fPNUj1u3wMm-LrR6szEba3dOeA align="left")

ü§î Hm. I don‚Äôt love this method compared to having the HTML form cleanly separated, but ok.

ü§î Presumably I copy / paste this on TOP of my existing val code (given the green + signs as a ‚Äúdiff‚Äù) but it‚Äôd be nice if the docs made this more explicit.

Anyway, let‚Äôs try that and hit Run again and see what happens now:

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/01rSiLT8jpZOwhzP7TX7J35fubILjN377rPBacE8XCGSxT8izmoowVn-DFkaaxFlP_5_rv8o1n5BDNYjFy2OViOox_2UiYMfkGoyvnZb2NK-wSkAavZI6u3P5ttD32JGXdsoW_4s6lxdxARxUQriAac align="left")

ü§î Oh, interesting. There are now TWO processes executing.

üò° I have clicked on every possible thing known to existence on the older one, and **cannot for the life of me figure out a way to *stop* it.**

ü§î Welp. Let‚Äôs copy the **link** into a new browser window and see what happens:

[https://www.val.town/v/webchick/tomatoPossum](https://www.val.town/v/webchick/tomatoPossum)

Nope. ;) That‚Äôs just the same pastebin kind of thing. I guess this is the Gist-like ‚Äúsharing‚Äù bit of the product.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/oM9J1DlqBtrPA_9GeQGHyGvNZ6kZEYwasYngQ0iQepWqlYgVfGK1NLe_qTZy_77UJiDkx2d2OfS9WWtMIF67KqRuSNKpDXKsxiLyM6E7upm2I0XEhFq2d-uePTRifbvTQeqR3WPK9MkcwBqeL9-aNgg align="left")

ü§î Ok, let‚Äôs try copying the **module URL**:

[https://esm.town/v/webchick/tomatoPossum](https://esm.town/v/webchick/tomatoPossum)

`{"statusCode":404,"error":"Not Found","message":"Sorry, that Val could not be found."}`

**OK, that‚Äôs at least something I can debug! :D**

ü§î Is it because I never ‚ÄúSaved‚Äù the val?

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/d3vlS-kajhhEfRI-Nl9JwNWP8eirYmKWW-nI4tnt1iti1KiiCWjlSR2_fE6sfTW-iKeqAW0I43djstMCqI4vkDSGb7OPAH3KXj5Hky4J8Cw5sgG0FUQUTbqChMfuPPNkV8Qw6_4VocJfSQJRCM-g6bI align="left")

‚úÖ No, Save is grayed out; apparently it autosaves (that‚Äôs nice).

ü§î Is there anything in **logs**?

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/fNk50MmJks-YQItOHWlhAq35Hq-2_P2ZzE_1yrN7r1Eg5IF_EnGAFF9EMcXVmxN21wqi2iW0Ql2wlgHQjLp9WOEcuNueFuRY37Dngd6tadrTt9_dTFcgXpEQLi8_eNdQ5ufkRph8S0Waby8RqRntKOk align="left")

ü§î Ok, says there are 19 log entries, that could potentially be useful? But when I click it...

üò° Hmmm. But **where** do I see the log entries? "**Logs" is blank, despite saying there were 19 of these on the screen before.**

ü§î Ah, if I click a *teeny tiny checkbox* called ‚ÄúSystem‚Äù I can see stuff in the Logs, but this appears to just be pulling in dependencies, so not helpful here.

ü§î Ok, trying *one* last thing, which is to go back to my locally hosted form.html and change the form action to the **module URL** instead of the **link** url.

üò° LOL nope. **Welp, I officially give up.**

# Conclusion/Recommendations

It‚Äôs very possible that this product is NOT for people without extensive server-side function / JS experience, in which case fair enough; this feedback may not be valuable to you.

However, consider that by adding a few sign-posts along the way, and making a concerted effort to drive new ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs this then?‚Äù users towards a seamlessly working example at the beginning of their journey, you could see a **huge** uptick in usage from people who know web development things really well, and could start to see the power of using your thing as well. üôÇ

Here are some specific recommendations:

* Add more of the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù on your product, from both within the product and *especially* during the onboarding flow‚Äîwhat use cases does it allow me to solve, what day-to-day headaches can it remove for me, and why is it better to do this with you than alternative vendors, etc?
    
* In the product interface, think through how to guide a new user, as quickly as possible, toward seeing the ‚Äúah-ha‚Äù value of your product. It looks like you have some good tutorials, but they‚Äôre a bit buried and not integrated into the product itself.
    
* Perform a docs audit: Take a swing through your docs and make sure they reflect changes you‚Äôve made to the UI since writing them. (e.g. which ‚ÄúCopy‚Äù do I use?)
    

Hope that helps! üòÄ
